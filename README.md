# A rudimentary r/Place

This project attempts to implement a small, reddit like r/place. The code is rather inefficent and can't handle a lot of pixels, but it is a proof of concept.

## Key features and technology representation

- A login and registration system with tokens to identify if a request to the API is valid and who made the request.
- API for pixel placing. Users will have api access via their tokens, so creation of bots on their end is possible.
- An interactive, realtime map for viewing/placing pixels.
